<h1>Blue Whale</h1>
     <p>The blue whale is classified as a mammal,contrary to what some believe is fish,
         the largest animal on the planet ever, weighing 173 tons, a figure that exceeds the size of all wild
          and marine animals, followed by an elephant. Its length is 30 metres.
           Her tongue can only weigh up to the weight of an elephant, and her heart may
            weigh up to the weight of a car. Whales are between the ages of 30 and 80,
             and the female is larger than the male. The whale travels for long distances of up
              to thousands of kilometers across the oceans in search of food and warmth for up to 4 months.</p>
        <h2>Nutrition</h2>
          <p>The blue whale feeds on large amounts of crustaceans of all kinds,
               but its favorite food is Krill, which are very small crustaceans.
                One adult whale feeds 3.6,000 kg per day of crelicate, an estimated 40 million krills per day.
                 They also eat small amounts of paddles, different sea plankton vary depending on the ocean
                  in which the whales are located, and blue whales in the frozen ocean eat prawns.
                   Blue whales need 1.5 million calories per day.</p>
        <h2 id="ff">Species and their spread</h2>
            <p>There are three major species of blue whales scattered around the world:
                 Ecuyols:Live in the north of the equator, specifically in the North Atlantic and Pacific Ocean.
                Intermedia Whales:Live south of the equator, specifically in the Antarctic Ocean. 
                 Previcoda whales:the smallest species called dwarf, found in the Indian Ocean and the South
                  Pacific</p>

         <h2 id="two">Risk of whale extinction</h2>
                   <p>Blue whales are classified as on average endangered,
                        with the end of the 19th and early 20th centuries spreading whaling in the Antarctic
                         Ocean and other ocean islands, such as Japan, Indonesiaand Iceland. 
                         Some studies have indicated that the number of blue whales currently does not exceed
                          20,000 worldwide, all because of overfishing, with an estimated 30,000 whales caught
                           the Antarctic Ocean alone in 1930, and the International Whaling Commission banning blue
                            whaling in 1966. As large as these whales, they fall prey to shark and predatory whale
                             attacks, and are wounded and killed annually as a result of large ships traveling
                              in the oceans.<br><br>Blue whales are exposed to risks other than fishing, namely global warming,
                              which increases ocean temperature and melts snow in poles, threatening the natural habitat of
                               blue whales. Active ocean maritime traffic is also considered to have a significant negative
                                impact on whales, with ships harming and killing whales, polluting ocean waters with harmful and
                                toxic fuel products for whales.</p>
