    <h3>⚫ Lack of Food : </h3>


    <p>
     
      <img class="banda" src="abdullah\banda.jpg"alt="banda" > <br>

      Mass starvation is the quick, one-way, surefire route to
       extinction—especially since hunger-weakened populations 
       are much more prone to disease and predation—and the effect 
       on the food chain can be disastrous. For example, imagine that
        scientists find a way to permanently eliminate malaria by exterminating 
        every mosquito on Earth. At first glance, that may seem like good news for
         us humans, but just think of the domino effect as all the creatures that
          feed on mosquitoes (like bats and frogs) go extinct, and all the animals 
          that feed on bats and frogs, and so on down the food chain.
    </p>
    <h4>⚫ Invasive Species :</h4>

    <p>

      <br><br>

        While most struggles for survival transpire over eons, sometimes
        the contest is quicker, bloodier, and more one-sided. If a plant
          or animal from one ecosystem is inadvertently transplanted into 
        another (usually by an unwitting human or an animal host), it can
        reproduce wildly, resulting in the extermination of the native 
        population. That's why American botanists wince at the mention of 
        kudzu, a weed that was brought  from Japan in the late 19th century
        and is now spreading at the rate of 150,000 acres per year,
        crowding out indigenous vegetation.

<h5> ⚫ Asteroid Strikes :</h5>
      <P>

        <img class="AsteroidStrikes" src="abdullah\Asteroid Strikes.jpg"alt="Asteroid Strikes" >
        <br>

        This is the first thing most people associate with the word "extinction," 
        and not without reason, since we all know that a meteor impact on the 
        Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico caused the disappearance of the dinosaurs 
        65 million years ago. It's likely that many of the Earth's mass extinctions—not
         only the K-T extinction, but also the much more severe Permian-Triassic
          extinction—were caused by such impact events, and astronomers are constantly
           on the lookout for comets or meteors that could spell the end of human 
           civilization.

      <h6> ⚫Better Adapted Competition :</h6>
      <p>
        <img class="fight" src="abdullah\fight.jpg"alt="fight" >
        <br>

        Here's where we risk succumbing to a dangerous tautology: By definition,
         "better-adapted" populations always win out over those that lag behind,
          and we often don't know exactly what the favorable adaptation was until
         after the event. For instance, no one would have thought that prehistoric
         mammals were better adapted than ​dinosaurs until the K-T extinction 
        changed the playing field. Usually, determining which is the "better 
        adapted" species takes thousands, and sometimes millions, of years.

        <h7>⚫ Human Predation :</h7>
        <p>


        Humans have only occupied the Earth for the last 50,000 or so years,
        so it's unfair to blame the bulk of the world's extinctions on Homo
        sapiens. There's no denying, though, that we've wreaked plenty of 
        ecological havoc during our brief time in the spotlight: hunting the
        starved, straggling megafauna mammals of the last Ice Age; depleting
        entire populations of whales and other marine mammals; and eliminating 
        the dodo bird and the passenger pigeon virtually overnight. Are we wise
        enough now to cease our reckless behavior? Only time will tell. <br>
