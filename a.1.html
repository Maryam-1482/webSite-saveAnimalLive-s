 <center><h3> The base Causes of Animals Becoming Endangered  </h3></center>
   <p class="one">
        Although natural forces can destroy or strain an animal population,
        increasingly the activities of man have caused a large numbers of animals to 
        become endangered. Admittedly some animals and plants, especially
        domesticated ones such as crops, livestock, and pets, have benefited
        and even flourished from the alterations man has made to the world.
        However, some animal populations have been placed under tremendous
        pressure as the result of these changes and, in some cases, the
        populations are dropping to significantly lower levels. Small populations
        or organisms with a limited distribution are extremely sensitive to the 
        factors causing endangerment, whether one relies on the ordinary sense of
        the word or the endangered species definition embodied in federal law.

    <h4>⚫ Loss of Habitat :  </h4>
  <p>
   <br>
        One of the most significant causes of endangered animals is habitat loss.
        While habitat may be lost due to natural forces (climate changes, geologic 
        changes), much of the habitat lost today is due to human activity. The 
        construction of dams, highways, canals, urbanization, and agriculture
        dramatically affect the inhabitants of native ecosystems. Even when portions
        of the ecosystem remain intact creating “islands,” the resulting habitat
        may be too small or too widely dispersed to support a species.

  <h5>⚫ Pathogens and Disease : </h5>
   
  <p>
        <img class="illdog" src="abdullah\illdog.jpg"alt="illdog"> <br><br><br>
    The spread of domesticated animals has also spread the diseases
    associated with them to new areas of the world. In some cases, the 
    diseases infected native populations which had little resistance to
    the invading pathogen. These diseases may reach epidemic levels in
    the native population, decimating their numbers. 
  </p>
 
  <h5>⚫ Environmental Pollution : </h5>

  <p>

     <img class="EnvironmentalPollution2" src="abdullah\Environmental Pollution2.jpg"alt="Environmental Pollution2"> <br>
    Pollution in many forms has endangered many animals. Pesticides
    and other chemicals introduced to an ecosystem may significantly
    harm untargeted species. For example, DDT used to fight mosquitoes
    was eventually linked to declines in the reproductive rates of birds.
    Other forms of pollution such as thermal, light and noise pollution 
    can each reduce survival rates of local animal populations.
    </p> 

    <h6>⚫ Lack of Genetic Diversity :</h6>
    <p>
      <img class="sheta" src="abdullah\sheta.jpg"alt="sheta"> <br>
    Once a species starts dwindling in numbers, there's a smaller 
    pool of available mates and often a corresponding lack of genetic 
    diversity. This is the reason it's much healthier to marry a complete
    stranger than your first cousin, since, otherwise, you run the risk 
    of "inbreeding" undesirable genetic traits, like susceptibility to
    fatal diseases. To cite just one example: Because of their extreme 
    habitat loss, today's dwindling population of African cheetahs suffers 
    from unusually low genetic diversity​ and, thus, may lack the resiliency
    to survive another major environmental disruption.
