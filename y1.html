<h2 class="hh2"> The creation for Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries</h2>
<p class="pare">The Sichuan Giant Panda Sanctuaries is one of several areas created to protect giant pandas.<br>
The panda center was originally established in Wolong in June 1980,</br>
but a catastrophic earthquake devastated the region in May 2008.<br>
The center has since reopened a few miles from its original location.</br>
Since May 2008, most of the pandas were moved to other (safer) locations: Bifeng Gorge has about 30.

renowned for its importance for the conservation of the giant panda, recognized as a “National Treasure” </br>
in China and as a flagship for global conservation efforts. <br>
The property is the largest and most significant remaining contiguous area of panda habitat in China and thus the world.</br>
It is also the most important source of giant panda for establishing the captive breeding population of the species,<br>
Whichgiant panda is rarely seen in the wild, only 1500-2000 of them remain.</br>
In addition to the giant panda,<br>
the property features a great number of endemic and threatened species of plants and animals,</br>
including other iconic mammal species such as the red panda,<br>
snow leopard and clouded leopard among the 109 species of mammals recorded (more than 20% of all Chinese mammals).</br>
The property is an important centre of endemism for some bird taxa with 365 bird species recorded, 300 of which breed locally.<br>
However the property is particularly important for flora,</br>
being one of the botanically richest sites of any temperate region in the world with some 5,000 – 6,000 species recorded.<br>
Many species are relicts, such as the dove tree, and there is significant diversity in groups such as magnolias, bamboos, rhododendrons, and orchids.</br>
The property is a major source and gene pool for hundreds of traditional medicinal plants, many now under threat.</p>
