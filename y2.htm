<h2 class="hh2"> The creation for Indian Ocean Whale Sanctuary </h2>
<img  src="youssef\whale01.jpg" width="600" height="465" align="right">
<p class="pare2">The first place in the world where whales Were protected was in a small portion<br> 
of the southeastern Indian Ocean</br>
<br>
After World War I, attention turned to ways of restraining pelagic whaling.</br>
<br> 
"The following decade saw many pious dleclatations,but litle action to conserve<br>
‘whales, However,in 1938 an inter-gov cemmental agreement was reached which</br>
included a provision for the protection of baleen “whalebone” whales (suborder Mysticeri)<br>
from pelagie whaling in the en-tire South Pacific from 70° co 16? West,</br>
(Elsewhere in the southern hemisphere it ‘was permitted south of 40°).<br>
</br>
“The South Pacific baleen whale sanetu- ary remained in force only a few years:<br>
it was reopened to Whaling in 1955,It had been easy to agree on the sanctuary 10</br>
begin with, since few whales were believed to live there.<br> 
</br>
The next move was made by the Interna sional Union for Conservation<br> 
of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), which convened a Workshop on Cetaesan Sanc</br>
-tuaries with UNEP in Mexico in February 1979,Many small protected areas were proposed,<br>
mainly in waters under nationalJurisdictions, However, in addition, it was suggested</br>
that the entire southeastern In-dian Ocean should be a sanctuary for the reat whales.<br>

with 23 countries supporting the agreement and Japan opposing it.</br><p><br>
</br>
<h3>Area</h3>
<p class="pare2">The northern boundary of the sanctuary follows the 40°S parallel of latitude except in<br> 
the Indian Ocean sector where it joins the southern boundary of the Indian Ocean Whale</br>
Sanctuary at 55°S,and around South America and into the South Pacific<br> 
where the boundary is at 60°S.</br>

<h2 class="hh2">The animals that live in Indian Ocean Whale Sanctuary </h2>
<p class="pare">There are many whales living in the reserve, but the most famous of them is the blue whale.</p>
<h3>The blue whale</h3>
<p class="pare2">The blue whale (Balaenoptera musculus) is a marine mammal belonging to<br> 
the baleen whale suborder Mysticeti.Reaching a maximum confirmed length of</br>
29.9 metres (98 ft) and a weighing up to 199 tonnes (196 long tons; 219 short tons),<br>
it is the largest animal known to have existed.</br>
The blue whale's long and slender body can be various shades of greyish-blue<br>
dorsally and somewhat lighter underneath.The blue whale was once abundant</br>
in nearly all the Earth's oceansuntil the end of the 19th century.<br>
It was hunted almost to the point of extinction by whalers until</br>
the International Whaling Commission banned all blue whale hunting in 1966.<br>
The International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed blue whales as</br>
endangered as of 2018.<br>
It continues to face numerous threats, both man-made</br>
(ship strikes, pollution, ocean noise and climate change),<br>
and natural (killer whale predation).underneath.</br>
